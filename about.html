	<div id="about">
		<p>I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design with a minor in Web Design, June 2011. Since then I have been freelancing and working on improving my skills until the right opportunity comes along. In September 2015 I graduated with my associates degree in Software Development from ITT Technical Institute, Canton MI.</p>
			

		<p>I am a full time mom to a wonderful little 4 year old boy. He is the light of my life and a big reason for my motivation to keep going. As well as recently engaged to my best friend and a huge part of my life. 
		</p>

		<p>I love to look at advertisements and billboards to see the different styles that everything is being put together in different ways. My favorite thing to do is designing, and now that I have the design background I want to be able to bring that design to life with the code
